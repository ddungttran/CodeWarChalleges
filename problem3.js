//In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?
//My first thought for this question was to return all the num to be negative

//I used Math.abs() to get the absolute value of num 
//I also have the - infront of Math.abb() to always get negative

function makeNegative(num) {
    // Code?
    return -Math.abs(num);
  }
